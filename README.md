## Thermostat
This is a basic thermostat app built using JavaScript.  It was created in order to
learn about and test JavaScript, jQuery and manipulating CSS and HTML elements after
input from the user.

## Weather API
The weather API ([Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)) pulls temperature
information from your entered location and presents it on screen.
